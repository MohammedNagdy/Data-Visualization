# **Bank Loans Data**
### by Mohammed Nagdy



This is a project includes exploratory and explanatory analysis for the data using univariate, bi-variate and multi-variate visualizations.

## Dataset

>This dataset includes loans data which can be found at https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv. This data includes around 113k data points/rows as well as 81 variables ranging from APR rates for borrowers to borrowers' states.


## Summary of Findings

>In our exploration we found out some correlations between some variables. Like the APR rate and borrower rate for the bank. As it makes sense that as the borrowing rate for the bank that borrows from the central bank increases their loans will be sold at a high rate. There's also correlation between the term period of the loan and the original amount of the loan. That is because having a longer period of a loan reduces the monthly period.


## Key Insights for Presentation

>For presentation I focused on the graphs that gives an overview for the user and answering some of the important question like would the borrowers default gving several factors. Plus, what are the major factors of choosing borrowers.

1. Employment Status is a major importance for understanding how many are going to pay their loans
2. APR rates. We found out that APR rates are not correlated with income nor credit score.
3. Credit score. credit score is not a major factor in determining the amount of loan given.

To sum up the analysis, I would say that the loans are fairly organized and there is no risk involved. However, the criteria for choosing borrowers depend heavily on income, employment status.
